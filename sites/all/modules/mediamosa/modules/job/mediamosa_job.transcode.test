Transcode without padding

In the past the option 'keep aspect ratio' was introduced in the transcoding parameters which can be filled in from the management portal.
When set to yes, in combination with a fixed size, at that moment it generated a video which size was within the bounding box of {size}, and maintained the aspect ratio.
This behaviour has changed recently (I missed the trac issue in which is was changed), and now black padding is added so that the size of the video is exactly {size}. While I can see the need for this behaviour, I also want the opportunity to have the previous situation, so that no padding is added.
I suggest the 'Maintain aspect ratio' drop down get 3 possible states:
* no: the video is rescaled to fit {size}, possibly deforming
* yes, add padding: the video is rescaled, aspect ratio maintained. Padding is added to create a video exactly of {size}
* yes, no padding: the video is rescaled, aspect ratio maintained. No padding is added. Resulting size of the video fits in the bounding box {size}, but it's absolutely not necessary that we get an exact fit.
Example.
Original material is 1024 x 600 pixels
Target size is 320 x 240
No: resulting video is 320 x 240 and 'highly deformed'
yes, padding: the video is scaled to 320 x 188, and 26pixels black padding is added on top and below to create a 320 x 240 video.
Yes, no padding: the video is scaled to 320 x 188.
