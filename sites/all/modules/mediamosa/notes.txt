Contains reminders and notes collected during migration.

Migration rules;

- Watchdog
  Convert any usage of watchdog to mediamosa::log() function.

- DB Layer
  db_query can be re-used, just remap the %s/%d operators to new parameter mapping.
  You can no longer use db_fetch_object / db_fetch_array; 
    use foreach
      ->fetchObject()
      ->fetchAssoc()



Notes:
- The 'version' field in error table has been dropped, was not used.



@todo:
Add rest call 'errorcodes' linked to vpx_shared_rest_errorcodes_get in old code.
