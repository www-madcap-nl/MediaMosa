Contains reminders and notes collected during migration.

You can delete a default transcode profile and end up with no default transcode profile...
You can't delete a global transcode profile because app_id can't be 0 and no check for is_app_admin.

Migration rules;

- Watchdog
  Convert any usage of watchdog to mediamosa::log() function.

- DB Layer
  db_query can be re-used, just remap the %s/%d operators to new parameter mapping.
  You can no longer use db_fetch_object / db_fetch_array; 
    use foreach
      ->fetchObject()
      ->fetchAssoc()
