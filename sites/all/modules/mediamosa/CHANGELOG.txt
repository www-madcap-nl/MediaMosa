Other changes (non-ticket related)
- Play proxy call will now return the ticket id in result.
- Fixed number of query bugs in AUT / ACL code.
- Fixed job server where 2 rows where inserted while only one was allowed.
- Added unique index on mediamosa_job_server table to prevent multiple rows on
  same parent job.
- Added foreign key on mediamosa_job_server to mediamosa_job - job_id.
- Prevented possible divided by zero problems in job server. 
- asset_id_root in mediamosa_asset_mediafile table is now deprecated, will be 
  removed in later versions.
- parent_id in mediamosa_asset table is now deprecated, will be removed in later
  versions.
- is_original_file boolean in mediamosa_asset_mediafile table is deprecated, is
  replaced by mediafile_id_source.
- mediafile_id_source is now either NULL or points to its original mediafile.
- Fixed still generation call /mediafile/$mediafile/still. 
- Fixed play_restriction code. Typo with 'time_restriction_' prevented working
  of this code in the play proxy code. Seems to be old bug dating back from 1.0.
- Added /version REST call.
- Empty metadata values is no longer allowed. This made the search query a bit
  faster.
- Statistics in 1.x falsely created new statistics based on what some unittest
  was testing. F.e. the CQL unit test would generate new stats based on the
  searches during test and store them as normal stats. This no longer is
  a bug because of the sandbox environment of 2.x unittests.
- Some ffmpeg versions give value 'N/A' for bitrate. This caused database errors
  when trying to insert. Fixed by converting all required numeric values to 
  integers.
- Conversion of some queries where NULL was inserted into NON-NULL allowed 
  values is creating problems in DP7 database. This is because the old D6 code
  unintentially forced NULL values to be empty strings. This behavor can not be
  replicated in D7. Decided to put those columns in the database to allow NULL
  values instead. Statistics as example had owner_id and group_id as non-null.
- Fixed /collection which had asset_id as required, which is only when the call
  was made as /asset/{asset_id}/collection.
- Removed field 'locked' from asset and asset output(s). Field was not 
  documented or used.
- Header fields item_count_total and item_offset are always present in the 
  header while in 1.x these only where found for multi item results. In case of
  single item results, then item_count_total will always be 1 and item_offset 0.
- mediafile output will include new mediafile_id_source which can hold the ID of
  the original mediafile. When empty, then the mediafile is a original.
- /asset/$asset_id/joblist [GET] will now return 705 (empty result) when no jobs
  where found, instead of result ID 601 (OK).
- /asset/$asset_id/metadata [POST] will now return 705 (empty result) when no
  metadata was added.
- /asset/$asset_id/still/create [POST] will now return the job_id in the
  items response when success. 1.x only returned a 601 success result ID.
- The 'limit' REST parameter, where used in REST calls, is no longer required in
  any REST call, its default is 200.
- Date types uses ISO8601 norm; 'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS' or 'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS'.
  Timezone specification in ISO8601 however is ignored for now. Its now allowed
  to enter '2007' or '2007-10' without triggering errors.
- Server IP/URL settings are now prepared/compliant for IPv7.
- MediaMosa is now UTF8 Compliant.
- asset/delete REST call now returns failures per failed asset and their cause.
- Fixed problems editing the transcode profile.
- Fixed migration problem on transcode profiles.
- REST call mediafile/$mediafile_id/uploadticket/create now also returns the
  ticket_id as separate value.
- Removed notices and warnings when mediafile's file on disk does not exists.
- Added new unit test listing under Browse tab.
- Added new development tool/module for testing REST calls.

  this flag in output in future versions, but will be removed in database in 
  future version.
- Introducing mediafile_id_source as replacement of is_original_file. This field
  is either NULL (is original) or points to the mediafile of which is its 
  original mediafile. 
- 1.7.3 migration to 2.0.0 database will now move child assets mediafiles to its
  root asset. This will make the database more reliable, faster and easier to
  maintain.
- Mediafile db field asset_id_root is now deprecated and will be removed in 
  future releases.
